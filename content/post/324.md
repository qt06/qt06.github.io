the United NationsInternational Day of Persons with Disabilities, 3 December 2012
十二月三日-联合国确立的国际残疾人日
Theme: Removing barriers to create an inclusive and accessible society for all
今年的主题：排除障碍为所有人创建全纳包容的无障碍社会

Background
背景
Over one billion people, or approximately 15 per cent of the world’s population, live with some form of disability.
全世界有十多亿人（大约占全球人口总数15%）生活在某种形式的残障之中。
Persons with disabilities, “the world’s largest minority”, often face barriers to participation in all aspects of society. 
作为全球最大的少数族群的残障群体，在全面参与和融入社会时往往会面临障碍。
Barriers can take a variety of forms, including those relating to the physical environment or to information and communications technology (ICT), or those resulting from legislation or policy, or from societal attitudes or discrimination. 
障碍形形色色，无处不在。包括物理环境，信息交流技术上的障碍，由立法和政策所导致的障碍，或者是来自于社会心态的隔阂和歧视。
The result is that persons with disabilities do not have equal access to society or services, including education, employment, health care, transportation, political participation or justice.
其结果是，残障人士不能与社会其他成员享受同样的社会和服务资源，涉及到教育，就业，医疗保健，交通出行，参与政治和法律事务。
Evidence and experience shows that when barriers to their inclusion are removed and persons with disabilities are empowered to participate fully in societal life, their entire community benefits. Barriers faced by persons with disabilities are, therefore, a detriment to society as a whole, and accessibility is necessary to achieve progress and development for all.
事实和经验证明，一旦阻止残障人士融入社会的障碍得以排除，一旦他们被赋予全面融入社会的能力和权利，整个社会将由此而受益。因此，残障人群所面临的障碍，实质上是有损于社会整体利益的障碍，建立无障碍的社会大环境是全人类共同进步和发展的必然趋势。
The Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (CRPD) recognizes that the existence of barriers constitutes a central component of disability. Under the Convention, disability is an evolving concept that “results from the interaction between persons with impairments and attitudinal and environmental barriers that hinder their full and effective participation in society on an equal basis with others.”
联合国《残疾人权利公约》指出，现存的社会障碍是制约残障人施展才能的关键因素。根据这一公约，残疾只是一个演变中的概念，“是伤残者和阻碍他们在与其他人平等的基础上充  分和切实地参与社会的各种态度和环境障碍相互作用所产生的结果。”
Accessibility and inclusion of persons with disabilities are fundamental rights recognized by the CRPD and are not only objectives, but also pre-requisites for the enjoyment of other rights. The CRPD (Article 9, accessibility) seeks to enable persons with disabilities to live independently and participate fully in all aspects of life and development. It calls upon States Parties to take appropriate measures to ensure that persons with disabilities have access to all aspects of society, on an equal basis with others, as well as to identify and eliminate obstacles and barriers to accessibility.
让残疾人无障碍地融入社会是《残疾人权利公约》所规定的基本权利，它不仅是公约的宗旨，而且是保障残疾人享受其他应有权利的先决条件。公约的第九条对无障碍作出了规定，即要求提供便利条件让残疾人独立生活，让其完全融入社会生活和社会发展的各个方面； 号召缔约国采取适当措施确保残疾人与其他社会成员一样全面参与社会的各项活动，并查明和消除一切阻碍实现无障碍环境的因素。
In spite of this, in many parts of the world today, lack of awareness and understanding of accessibility as a cross-cutting development issue remains an obstacle to the achievement of progress and development through the Millennium Development Goals, as well as other internationally agreed outcomes for all.
尽管国际社会作出了如此大的努力，但在世界的许多地方，对实现无障碍环境缺乏认识和理解是制约实现联合国千年目标所确定的社会进步和发展指标以及国际社会所公认的其他公共目标的重要障碍。，
The commemoration of International Day of Persons with Disabilities in 2012 provides an opportunity to address this exclusion by focusing on promoting accessibility and removing all types of barriers in society.
纪念今年的国际残疾人权益日旨在提醒世人正视残疾人所面临的社会隔离，从而重视推进无障碍环境的建设，消除社会上现存的各种障碍。
